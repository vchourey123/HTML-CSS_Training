        <p> rem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

            m Ipsum is not simply rando
             text.</br> It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 
             45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin 
             professor<br> <i>'re an absolute beginner in web development, you can learn the basics of HTML here. This video covers setting up an HTML file, a</i></br> at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one o

             and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, di
             scovered the <br><em>undoubtable source.</em></br> Lorem Ipsum comes from sections
              1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes o

              first line <br><b>of Lorem Ipsum</b></br>, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</a>.", comes from a
               line in section 1.10.32.
